# Introduction-to-Java

This repository was used for my university "Introduction to Java" course.

It includes several projects and training exercises from the course and many solved problems from famous sites such as "Geeks for Geeks".

The code implements heavy use of Object-Oriented Programming, Polymorphism and Inheritance, as well as Time and Space Complexity and Recursion.
